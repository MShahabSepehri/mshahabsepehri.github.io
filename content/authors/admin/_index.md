I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California, where I work with Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi at the USC Center on AI Foundations for Science (AIF4S). My research focuses on reasoning and reliability in generative models, particularly vision-language and diffusion models. 

I received my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from USC in 2025 and dual B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022 from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked on detection algorithms for computer vision.
